The most common causes of this are the following: o Power to a\nremote I/O rack or Model-B I/O interface unit is interrupted. o The cable between the MAIN CPU PCB and the\nprocess I/O board, racks, or Model-B interface units has been disconnected or is faulty. o Electrical interference\nbetween the I/O cables and other cables. This can be eliminated by physically separating the I/O cables from other\nwiring. In very electrically noisy environments, it might be necessary to use optical isolators with these cables.\nRemedy:  Check the cabling between the MAIN CPU PCB (JB-18 connector) and the process I/O board and/or model A or B\ninterface modules. Check power to the remote Model A I/O racks and model B I/O interface modules. If corrections to\nthese do not correct the problem, check the four numbers displayed in this error message. The first value must be\ninterpreted bit-wise. If a bit is 1, the corresponding condition has been detected: Bit 0: (CFER) A CRC or framing\nerror has been detected by the SLC-2 chip on the MAIN CPU PBC. This is most frequently the result of the problems\nlisted above. Otherwise, it might indicate faulty SLC-2 chip, wiring between this and the JB-1B connector on the main\nPCB, or faulty process I/O, model-A I/O rack, or model-B interface unit. Bit 1: (CALM) An error has been detected by\na slave SLC-2 (process I/O board, Model-A rack, or Model B interface unit). More information is provided by the\nsecond number displayed with the PRIO-020 error. Bit 2: (CMER) A communication error has been detected by a\nslave SLC-2. The potential causes are similar to those for a CFER. Bit 3: (IPRER): Internal parity error accessing\nSLC-2 internal RAM. This indicates a faulty SLC-2 chip. In this case, the third and fourth numbers displayed with the\nPRIO-020 error is the address and and data for which the error was detected. This indicates a faulty SLC-2 chip. Bit 4:\n(OPRER): Parity error accessing external RAM by the SLC-2 chip. This might indicate bad DRAM or CMOS memory\non the MAIN CPU PCB. Bit 5: (ALMI): Indicates an alarm signaled from outside the SLC-2. Check the controller\nAlarm Log for other errors reported. Bit 6: (BSY): Auto scan is running. This might be either 0 or 1 and does not\nindicate an error. Bit 7: (CEND): Auto-scan cycle has completed. This might be either 0 or 1 and does not indicate an\nerror. The second number displayed is significant only if the CMER bit above is one. Bits 0-4: Indicate the position in\nthe I/O Link chain of the slave unit in which error was detected. A value of 1 indicates the unit connected directly to\nthe I/O LINK connector. Bit 5 (CFER): Indicates a CRC or framing error detected by the slave SLC-2. The causes are\nsimilar to those for a CFER error detected by the MAIN CPU SLC-2. Bit 6 (ALMI): Indicates an error asserted outside\nthe slave SLC-2. This may indicate a problem with process I/O board, model-B I/O rack, or model-B interface unit\nhardware. Bit 7 (SYALM): Indicates a watchdog alarm or parity error detected by the slave SLC-2.

There are (2) likely causes:\n2A) Target pressure is at very low or high end of gun operating range (tips are likely touching part).\n2B) Friction in gun mechanism has increased considerably since gun was autotuned (tips are likely NOT\ntouching part).\nRemedy:\nShortage 1)\n1A) When tip wear compensation is used, close axis limit is adjusted to avoid over-stroking gun (ClosLim\nbecomes smaller than StdLim when caps are worn). To extend axis limit, change tips, then run tip wear comp\nupdate program when using tip wear comp. Next, check the original close limit (StdLim) setting on servo gun\nsetup screen and adjust if not correct.\n1B) Increase pushing depth in pressure schedule (set $sgsyscfg.$sho_pshdpth=TRUE to see pushing depth\nparameter).\n1C) Reduce part thickness in the pressure schedule so it is closer to actual part thickness.\n1D) If using tip wear compensation, re-master the gun by running the tip wear compensation update program.\nOtherwise, refer to 1B or re-master the gun with new tips from the gun master screen.\n1E) Adjust the gun mechanism to relieve the restriction. Re-tune the gun (autotune) and calibrate pressure after\nadjustment.\nShortage 2)\n2A) Re-tune the gun (autotune) then confirm pressure calibration. If problem persists, or if the alarm occurs\nduring tip wear measurement, autotune with Initial Filter set to a value between 10-30. To see Initial Filter item,\nset $sgsyscfg.$sho_atn_cfg=TRUE then press enter on Auto Tune item from Gun Setup Utility before tuning.\n2B) Re-tune the gun (autotune) to adjust the gun close detection limit, then confirm pressure calibration.

This is normally the result of an operation time-out. The auto\ncalibration can abort for several reasons. The function of this alarm is as follows: First, the Auto Calibration Aborted\nalarm will post if an error has occurred. The next alarm will contain the cause of the auto calibration to abort. Cause 1:\nWhile searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the calibration table, the calibration timed out by reaching\nthe maximum number of attempts to establish the minimum or maximum flow rate output values. This can be a result\nof improper fluid restriction selection, non-attainable calibration table flow ranges, or a bad fluid regulator. The\nresulting alarms would be PNT1-251, Failed to find upper limit or PNT1-252, Failed to find lower limit. Cause 2:\nCalibration resulted in non-increasing command values in the calibration table data. The slope of the calibration table\nis negative. Increasing output values do not result in increased flow rate. The result error code will be PNT1-254\nNon-increasing cal table. Cause 3: The calibration routine calculated output values that are above or below the\nmaximum or minimum output values defined in the Applicator Parameters for the fluid regulator. The minimum output\nvalues in counts are low-res: 200, hi-res: 1600, and the maximum output values in counts are low-res: 1000, and hi-res:\n8000. The restrictor size is not compatible with the desired flow rate range and the material attempting to be calibrated.\nThe resulting error codes will be PNT1-255 Calculated output > max output or PNT1-256 Calculated output < min\noutput. Cause 4: The calibration has been aborted by the user or has been interrupted by another fault such as an\nEMERGENCY STOP during calibration. Or, the robot failed to reach the proper location in order to calibrate. See\nother alarms to determine the cause of the fault.\nRemedy: Remedy 1:  Increase the number of Maximum Calibration Trys in the AccuStat setup. Verify restrictor, regulator and\ncalibration flow rate range in the AccuStat Color Data for that valve. Remedy 2: Verify all equipment is operating\nproperly. Check the linear potentiometer feedback (AIN[1, DISP], the regulator operation, and that the trigger is\nopening and closing properly. Verify attainable values have been set in the AccuStat Color Data for the requested\nminimum and maximum flow rates. Remedy 3: Verify that the fluid regulator is functioning properly. Change the\nfluid restrictor size to better accommodate the requested flow rate range. Change the requested flow rate range in the\nAccuStat Color Data setup.

First, the Auto Calibration Aborted\nalarm will post if an error has occurred. The next alarm will contain the cause of the auto calibration to abort. Cause 1:\nWhile searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the cal table, the calibration timed-out by reaching the\nmaximum number of attempts to establish the minimum or maximum flow rate output values. This can be a result of\nimproper fluid restriction selection, non-attainable cal table flow ranges, or a bad fluid regulator. The resulting alarms\nwould be PNT1-251, Failed to find upper limit or PNT1-252, Failed to find lower limit. Cause 2: Calibration resulted\nin non-increasing command values in the calibration table data. The slope of the calibration table is negative.\nIncreasing output values do not result in increased flow rate. The result error code will be PNT1-254 Non-increasing\ncal table. Cause 3: The calibration routine calculated output values that are above or below the maximum or minimum\noutput values defined in the Applicator Parameters for the fluid regulator. The minimum output values in counts are\n(low- res: 200, hi-res: 1600) and the maximum output values in counts are (low-res: 1000, and hi-res: 8000).

First, the Auto Calibration Aborted\nalarm will post if an error has occurred. The next alarm will contain the cause of the auto calibration to abort. Cause 1:\nWhile searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the cal table, the calibration timed-out by reaching the\nmaximum number of attempts to establish the minimum or maximum flow rate output values. This can be a result of\nimproper fluid restriction selection, non-attainable cal table flow ranges, or a bad fluid regulator. The resulting alarms\nwould be PNT1-251, Failed to find upper limit or PNT1-252, Failed to find lower limit. Cause 2: Calibration resulted\nin non-increasing command values in the calibration table data. The slope of the calibration table is negative.\nIncreasing output values do not result in increased flow rate. The result error code will be PNT1-254 Non-increasing\ncal table. Cause 3: The calibration routine calculated output values that are above or below the maximum or minimum\noutput values defined in the Applicator Parameters for the fluid regulator.

The\nrestrictor size is not compatible with the desired flow rate range and the material attempting to be calibrated. The\nresulting error codes will be PNT1-255 Calculated output > max output or PNT1-256 Calculated output < min output.\nCause 4: The calibration has been aborted by the user or has been interrupted by another fault. If the cell has been\nemergency stopped during the calibration. The robot failed to reach the proper location in order to calibrate. See other\nalarms to determine the cause of the fault.\nRemedy:  Remedy 1: Increase the number of Maximum Calibration Trys in the AccuStat setup. Verify restrictor, regulator and\ncalibration flow rate range in the AccuStat Color Data for that valve. Remedy 2: Verify all equipment is operating\nproperly. Check the linear potentiometer feedback (AIN[1, DISP], the regulator operation, and that trigger is opening\nand closing properly. Verify attainable values have been set in the AccuStat Color Data for the requested minimum\nand maximum flow rates. Remedy 3: Verify that the fluid regulator is functioning properly.
